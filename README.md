The progressive degradation of the nervous system's structure and function characterizes the diverse group of conditions known as neurodegenerative diseases.

Alzheimer's disease, Ataxia, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Motor neuron disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, amongst others.
